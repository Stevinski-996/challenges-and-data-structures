### Challenge A: Array Reversal
Description : 
The task in this challenge is to create a function named ArrayReversal that reverses the elements of an array without using any built-in methods provided by the C# language. This means you have to implement the logic to reverse the array manually. The function should accept an array as its parameter and return a new array where the elements are in the reverse order.

### Challenge B: Most Frequent Number
Description : 
This solution iterates over the array using nested for loops to count the frequency of each element. It then compares the frequencies to determine the most frequent number. If there are multiple numbers with the same highest frequency, it returns the first one found among them.

### Challenge 2 : Maximum Value
Description : 
This function identifies the highest number in a list of integers.  It begins by assuming the first number in the list is the largest. Then, it systematically examines each remaining number. If it finds a number bigger than the current "largest", it updates its record. After checking all the numbers, the function returns the final recorded largest value.
